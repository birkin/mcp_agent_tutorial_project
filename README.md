# mcp_agent_tutorial_project

A professional-development-day investigation.

Goal: to explore a protocol for how large language models can use not just use tools to perform tasks, but can decide which tools to use.

## preparatory research

Used chatgpt's deep-research for an overview of mcp/agent tutorials.

- [link](https://chatgpt.com/share/6821f6dd-bfcc-8006-98e2-8704797b796a) (took about 8-minutes)


## chosen tutorial

- "Model Context Protocol (MCP) using Ollama" (MCP Servers using Local LLMs tutorial) -- by Mehul Gupta _(Mar 29, 2025)_
- [link](https://medium.com/data-science-in-your-pocket/model-context-protocol-mcp-using-ollama-e719b2d9fd7a)


## setting up Ollama

I already have Ollama installed on my system.

```bash
% ollama --version
Warning: could not connect to a running Ollama instance
Warning: client version is 0.6.5
```

(I don't have the Ollama server running; not sure why the version also has a warning.)

### upgrading Ollama

I want to ensure I'm using a recent version of Ollama -- but how to upgrade depends on how I installed it (I don't remember).

```bash
% ls -l $(which ollama)
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel    50B May 21  2024 /usr/local/bin/ollama@ -> /Applications/Ollama.app/Contents/Resources/ollama
```

...shows that I installed it as an app. Downloading the newest version from the website...

Download link: <https://ollama.com/download>

```bash
% ollama --version
ollama version is 0.6.8
```

The deep-research document notes "...A 32â€¯GB M1 can comfortably run 7B to 13B parameter models...", so I'll figure out how to specify the `7b` version of the `qwen2.5` model the tutorial recommends ([link](https://ollama.com/library/qwen2.5)). But I'll note that as of about a week ago, qwen3 came out, so I'll try that, eventually, too (note to self: the version I should be able to run is the `8b` version).

Ok, the command-pattern to load a model, specifying the size: `ollama pull qwen2.5:7b`.

Ok, it's installed:

```bash
% ollama list           
NAME                                                    ID              SIZE      MODIFIED      
qwen2.5:7b                                              845dbda0ea48    4.7 GB    5 seconds ago    
[snip] (other models listed)
```

### running the Ollama server

To see if it's running:

```bash
% curl 127.0.0.1:11434
curl: (7) Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 11434 after 0 ms: Couldn't connect to server
```

To start it:

```bash
% ollama serve
```

...then:

```bash
% curl 127.0.0.1:11434
Ollama is running
```

This will keep the ollama server running as long as the terminal session is open. 

To keep the server running in the background, use `ollama serve &` (lifetime of terminal session) or `nohup ollama serve &` (needs to be killed manually).

Note: running the ollama server doesn't automatically load a model. You can load a model persistently for an interactive chat session via:

```bash
% ollama run qwen2.5:7b
>>> Send a message (/? for help)
```

But that doesn't confirm that the model is running in the server. The only way to do that via the api is like:

```bash
% curl -X POST localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{"model":"qwen2.5:7b","prompt":"","stream":false}' | jq
{
  "model": "qwen2.5:7b",
  "created_at": "2025-05-12T16:15:37.730822Z",
  "response": "",
  "done": true,
  "done_reason": "load"
}
```

## Preparing the json-config file

The json-config file is a configuration file for the MCP server. It contains the following information:

- `globalShortcut`: the global shortcut to use to access the MCP server
- `mcpServers`: a list of MCP servers to use

As seen in the json-config template file, this json-config specifies three MCP servers. We'll take them one at a time.

### sqlite

The `mcp-server-sqlite` server is a simple server that can interact with a SQLite database. Its pypi [page](https://pypi.org/project/mcp-server-sqlite/). 

The argument for installation is `uvx` -- which uses `uv` (the `uv` package manager for `uv` packages)([link](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)). The uvx command is an alias for `uv tool run`. It allows users to execute command-line tools provided by Python packages in isolated, ephemeral environments without permanently installing them.

I have uv installed, so I'm set.

```bash
% uv --version
uv 0.7.3 (3c413f74b 2025-05-07)
```

### ddg-search

The `duckduckgo-mcp-server` server can interact with the DuckDuckGo search engine. Its pypi [page](https://pypi.org/project/duckduckgo-mcp-server/).

It, too uses `uvx` for installation, so I'm set.


### filesystem

The filesystem mcp-server is auto-installed by `npx`, like `uvx`, on-the-fly. 

My version might be very old, so I'll upgrade it.

```bash
% npx -v
10.8.2
```

IIRC, `np` and `npx` are installed when installing `node`. I don't remember how I installed that.

```bash
% which npx
/Users/me/.nvm/versions/node/v18.20.7/bin/npx
```

chatgpt says I must have installed that via `nvm`, and that a way to upgrade is `nvm install node`. Did that. Now...

```bash
% npx -v
11.3.0
```

Ok. chatgpt says the path in the filesystem command is the path that the filesystem mcp-server will read/write from. I'll create it in the outer stuff directory, and call it `ollama_mcp_filesystem`.

Ok. I ran the save_json.py script, and it created the mcp_servers.json file in the outer stuff directory -- with the actual paths.

```bash
% uv run --env-file "../.env" "./save_json.py"
```


## Setting up MCPHost

### install go

It's been ages since I learned Go... so to upgrade/reinstall...

- <https://go.dev/doc/install> has a `Download 1.24.3` button.
- I want the `Apple macOS (ARM64)` file.
- That took a while; thought it was hung!

```bash
% go version
go version go1.24.3 darwin/arm64
```

### install mcphost

Ran `go install github.com/mark3labs/mcphost@latest`. Downloaded lots of stuff to mysterious unknown destinations.

Ok, installed the main binary-file to `/Users/me/go/bin/mcphost`, with lots of supporting files in `/Users/me/go/pkg`.

### run mcphost

The tutorial says to run `mcphost...`, but that doesn't work for me.

```bash
% which mcphost
mcphost not found
```

Good that I tracked down the install location. Ok, to run it...

```bash
% /Users/me/go/bin/mcphost -m ollama:qwen2.5 --config "/path/to/mcp_agent_tutorial_stuff/mcp_servers.json"

Whoa; cool.

  Assistant:

  It seems there is a persistent issue with querying the table 5_referents. Let's try another approach to determine if this table exists and,
  if so, how many records it contains.                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                             
  First, let's verify that the table exists by checking its schema again:                                                                    

    SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name = '5_referents';                                                              

  If the table does exist, we can attempt to query it in a different way or check other related tables for indirect information. However,    
  since the direct count query is causing an issue, let's try a different method:                                                            
       
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM 5_referents;                                                                                                        
       
  This should give us the number of records in the 5_referents table.                                                                        
       
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM 5_referents;                                                                                                        
       
    Database error: unrecognized token: "5_referents"                                                                                        
       
  It appears that there is a consistent issue with directly querying the 5_referents table. Given this, we can infer that either the table   
  does not exist or there might be some underlying database issues.                                                                          
       
  To provide more context and help further, could you please check if the table exists in your database through another tool or method? If   
  it's essential to know the exact number of records, we might need to look into the database setup or consult with a database administrator.

  Assistant:                                                                                                                                 
  Given the persistent issues with directly querying the    
  5_referents table, it might be helpful to try an          
  alternative method or approach. However, we can attempt to
  fetch a few records and see if any data is returned. Let's
  use a SELECT query to retrieve three random records from  
  the table:

  Let's execute this query:                                 
                                                            
    SELECT * FROM 5_referents LIMIT 3;

Directly querying the db:

Parse error: unrecognized token: "5_referents"
  SELECT * FROM 5_referents LIMIT 3;
                ^--- error here
```

...because the table name has a leading number. The correct query results:

  You: When you perform your queries, try putting the table name in quotes, like "5_referents" instead of 5_referents -- and see if that helps.

### referent_names fields

tl;dr -- fail

```bash
  You: show me the fields in the table "6_referent_names".

  Assistant:                                                                                                                                  


  To show you the fields in the table "6_referent_names", we can use a DESCRIBE or PRAGMA TABLE_INFO command. However, since we are using     
  SQLite, we will use a SELECT * FROM statement to retrieve the schema information.                                                           
                                                                                                                                              
  Let's execute the query to list all the fields in the 6_referent_names table.

  The fields in the 6_referent_names table are:                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                              
  1. id: An integer that serves as the primary key for this table.                                                                            
  2. name: A text field containing the name associated with each reference.

The actual `6_referent_names` fields:

### referent_names records

```bash
  You: if I run the query ```select * from "6_referent_names" limit 5;``` -- it shows me the data, but no column-names. How can I also see the column-names?

  It seems there was an issue with the DESCRIBE command. Let's proceed by directly fetching and displaying both the column names and the first
  five rows of data from the 6_referent_names table.

### adding names to 5_referents

tl;dr -- terrible fail

```bash
  You: For each of first three records in the table "5_referents", find the matching name record in the table "6_referent_names" by matching 5_referents.primary_name_id with 6_referent_names.id -- and show 6_referent_names.first and 6_referent_names.last in the output.

  Assistant:

  Let's execute a SQL query to join the 5_referents table with the 6_referent_names table based on the primary_name_id field from 5_referents 
  matching the id field from 6_referent_names. We will then select and display the first and last names from the 6_referent_names table for   
  the first three records in the 5_referents table.

### querying 6_referent_names

tl;dr -- fail, and again a claimed success

```bash
  To find all records in the 6_referent_names table where the first name contains any spelling of "Harriet", we can use a SQL query with the  
  LIKE operator to match the pattern.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                              
  Here is the query:                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                              
    SELECT * FROM "6_referent_names" WHERE first LIKE '%Harriet%';

That _looks_ reasonable, but the real query:

```bash
sqlite> SELECT * FROM "6_referent_names" WHERE first LIKE '%Harriet%';
5398|5386|8|Harriet|Wilson
```

### writing to file

tl;dr -- a fail, and then a success

#### The first time...

```bash
p  You: find all the records in the table "6_referent_names" where the field first contains any spelling of "Harriet", and save that to a report titled "harriet_research.txt".

For reference, as noted above...

```bash
sqlite> SELECT * FROM "6_referent_names" WHERE first LIKE '%Harriet%';
5398|5386|8|Harriet|Wilson
```

The file-writer created a new directory named `harriet_research`, and created a file named `harriet_research.txt` in it.

#### The second time...

```bash

  This indicates that the person named Harriet Wilson was found in the table 6_referent_names with the specified criteria.                    
```

I had deleted the `harriet_research` directory, and specified a different location for the write-root-directory in the json file, but this time the writer did not create the directory, just a file named `harriet_research.txt`. And it does contain the correct info.

```bash
Results of the query:

[{'id': 5398, 'referent_id': 5386, 'name_type_id': 8, 'first': 'Harriet', 'last': 'Wilson'}]
```

This time I exited the session, then re-started it, and then ran the query again -- so my hypothesis is that the extensive context was negatively affecting the "results" production.
