# mcp_agent_tutorial_project

A professional-development-day investigation.

_(2025-May-12-Monday)_


## preparatory research

Used chatgpt's deep-research for an overview of mcp/agent tutorials.

- [link](https://chatgpt.com/share/6821f6dd-bfcc-8006-98e2-8704797b796a) (took about 8-minutes)


## chosen tutorial

- "Model Context Protocol (MCP) using Ollama" (MCP Servers using Local LLMs tutorial) -- by Mehul Gupta _(Mar 29, 2025)_
- [link](https://medium.com/data-science-in-your-pocket/model-context-protocol-mcp-using-ollama-e719b2d9fd7a)


## setting up Ollama

I already have Ollama installed on my system.

```bash
% ollama --version
Warning: could not connect to a running Ollama instance
Warning: client version is 0.6.5
```

(I don't have the Ollama server running; not sure why the version also has a warning.)

### upgrading Ollama

I want to ensure I'm using a recent version of Ollama -- but how to upgrade depends on how I installed it (I don't remember).

```bash
% ls -l $(which ollama)
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel    50B May 21  2024 /usr/local/bin/ollama@ -> /Applications/Ollama.app/Contents/Resources/ollama
```

...shows that I installed it as an app. Downloading the newest version from the website...

Download link: <https://ollama.com/download>

```bash
% ollama --version
ollama version is 0.6.8
```

The deep-research document notes "...A 32â€¯GB M1 can comfortably run 7B to 13B parameter models...", so I'll figure out how to specify the `7b` version of the `qwen2.5` model the tutorial recommends ([link](https://ollama.com/library/qwen2.5)). But I'll note that as of about a week ago, qwen3 came out, so I'll try that, eventually, too (note to self: the version I should be able to run is the `8b` version).

Ok, the command-pattern to load a model, specifying the size: `ollama pull qwen2.5:7b`.

Ok, it's installed:

```bash
% ollama list           
NAME                                                    ID              SIZE      MODIFIED      
qwen2.5:7b                                              845dbda0ea48    4.7 GB    5 seconds ago    
[snip] (other models listed)
```

### running the Ollama server

To see if it's running:

```bash
% curl 127.0.0.1:11434
curl: (7) Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 11434 after 0 ms: Couldn't connect to server
```

To start it:

```bash
% ollama serve
```

...then:

```bash
% curl 127.0.0.1:11434
birkin@Brown-50021K9L ~ % curl 127.0.0.1:11434
Ollama is running
```

This will keep the ollama server running as long as the terminal session is open. 

To keep the server running in the background, use `ollama serve &` (lifetime of terminal session) or `nohup ollama serve &` (needs to be killed manually).

Note: running the ollama server doesn't automatically load a model. You can load a model persistently for an interactive chat session via:

```bash
% ollama run qwen2.5:7b
>>> Send a message (/? for help)
```

But that doesn't confirm that the model is running in the server. The only way to do that via the api is like:

```bash
% curl -X POST localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{"model":"qwen2.5:7b","prompt":"","stream":false}' | jq
{
  "model": "qwen2.5:7b",
  "created_at": "2025-05-12T16:15:37.730822Z",
  "response": "",
  "done": true,
  "done_reason": "load"
}
```

## Preparing the json-config file

The json-config file is a configuration file for the MCP server. It contains the following information:

- `globalShortcut`: the global shortcut to use to access the MCP server
- `mcpServers`: a list of MCP servers to use

As seen in the json-config template file, this json-config specifies three MCP servers. We'll take them one at a time.

### sqlite

The `mcp-server-sqlite` server is a simple server that can interact with a SQLite database. Its pypi [page](https://pypi.org/project/mcp-server-sqlite/). 

The argument for installation is `uvx` -- which uses `uv` (the `uv` package manager for `uv` packages)([link](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)). The uvx command is an alias for `uv tool run`. It allows users to execute command-line tools provided by Python packages in isolated, ephemeral environments without permanently installing them.

I have uv installed, so I'm set.

```bash
% uv --version
uv 0.7.3 (3c413f74b 2025-05-07)
```

### ddg-search

The `duckduckgo-mcp-server` server can interact with the DuckDuckGo search engine. Its pypi [page](https://pypi.org/project/duckduckgo-mcp-server/).

It, too uses `uvx` for installation, so I'm set.


### filesystem

The filesystem mcp-server is installed by `npx`. My version might be very old, so I'll upgrade it.

```bash
% npx -v
10.8.2
```

IIRC, `np` and `npx` are installed when installing `node`. I don't remember how I installed that.

% which npx
/Users/me/.nvm/versions/node/v18.20.7/bin/npx
```

chatgpt says I must have installed that via `nvm`, and that a way to upgrade is `nvm install node`. Did that. Now...

```bash
% npx -v
11.3.0
```

Ok. chatgpt says the path in the filesystem command is the path that the filesystem mcp-server will read/write from. I'll create it in the outer stuff directory, and call it `ollama_mcp_filesystem`.

Ok. I ran the save_json.py script, and it created the mcp_servers.json file in the outer stuff directory -- with the actual paths.

```bash
% uv run --env-file "../.env" "./save_json.py"
```


## Setting up MCPHost

### install go

It's been ages since I learned Go... so to upgrade/reinstall...

- <https://go.dev/doc/install> has a `Download 1.24.3` button.
- I want the `Apple macOS (ARM64)` file.
- That took a while; thought it was hung!

```bash
% go version
go version go1.24.3 darwin/arm64
```

### install mcphost

Ran `go install github.com/mark3labs/mcphost@latest`. Downloaded lots of stuff to mysterious unknown destinations.

Ok, installed the main binary-file to `/Users/me/go/bin/mcphost`, with lots of supporting files in `/Users/me/go/pkg`.

### run mcphost

The tutorial says to run `mcphost...`, but that doesn't work for me.

```bash
% which mcphost
mcphost not found
```

Good that I tracked down the install location.

```bash
% /Users/me/go/bin/mcphost -m ollama:qwen2.5 --config "/path/to/mcp_agent_tutorial_stuff/mcp_servers.json"

  Assistant:

  It seems there is a persistent issue with querying the table 5_referents. Let's try another approach to determine if this table exists and,
  if so, how many records it contains.                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                             
  First, let's verify that the table exists by checking its schema again:                                                                    

    SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name = '5_referents';                                                              

  If the table does exist, we can attempt to query it in a different way or check other related tables for indirect information. However,    
  since the direct count query is causing an issue, let's try a different method:                                                            
       
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM 5_referents;                                                                                                        
       
  This should give us the number of records in the 5_referents table.                                                                        
       
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM 5_referents;                                                                                                        
       
    Database error: unrecognized token: "5_referents"                                                                                        
       
  It appears that there is a consistent issue with directly querying the 5_referents table. Given this, we can infer that either the table   
  does not exist or there might be some underlying database issues.                                                                          
       
  To provide more context and help further, could you please check if the table exists in your database through another tool or method? If   
  it's essential to know the exact number of records, we might need to look into the database setup or consult with a database administrator.

### other

```bash
  You: For each of first three records in the table "5_referents", find the matching name record in the table "6_referent_names" by matching 5_referents.primary_name_id with 6_referent_names.id -- and show 6_referent_names.first and 6_referent_names.last in the output.

  Assistant:

  Let's execute a SQL query to join the 5_referents table with the 6_referent_names table based on the primary_name_id field from 5_referents 
  matching the id field from 6_referent_names. We will then select and display the first and last names from the 6_referent_names table for   
  the first three records in the 5_referents table.

Compare that to running the query directly in the sqlite database:

```bash
